            MM: One of the hurdles in the flexo growth story, was the non-availability of good plate-making solutions and trade shops, where flexo jobs could be well defined - or even gravure jobs could be converted to flexo. India has always been predominantly a gravure market. With increase in trade shops and fantastic developments in plate-making technology, flexo and gravure stand together on a comparable dias. This has led to an increase in print quality. Additionally, flexo still continues to be the best solution for printing on thinner materials as well as extensible and tricky materials which are not so easy to control on the gravure press.
